1.	Set Number of Turns
As a player, I want to be able to set the number of turns the dice game will last so that I can choose whether I want to play a short or long game.
2.	Roll Dice
As a player, I want to be able to roll dice so that I will be able to play the game. 
3.	Reroll Dice
As a player, I want to be able to pay points (50 per dice for up to 2 per turn) in order to reroll dice so that I can potentially increase my chances of winning a round.
4.	Select 3 Pairs of Dice
As a player, I want to be able to choose which dice I’ll group together in pairs so that I can create strong (high value) pairs in order to try to win at least one of the rounds this turn.
5.	Select Dice Pairs to Use In Each Round 
As a player, I want to be able to strategically pick which dice pairs will be played in each round because being able to do will help me win rounds by trying to play strong pairs in rounds where I think others might play weak ones.
6.	Use Hindrance
As a player, I want to be able to use a small number of points to use the Hindrance action to increase my chances of winning by lowering the value of another player’s dice pair. 
7.	Use Dice-Block!
As a player, I want to be able to use a larger number of points to Dice-Block! another player which will increase my chances of winning that round by severely lowering the value of another player’s dice pair.
8.	Use Lucky Dice!
As a player, I want to be able to use points to use the Lucky Dice! action to protect my roll when I suspect other players might be planning to sabotage my dice with either Hindrance or Dice-Block! This has the added bonus of making them waste points for no gain if I can predict when they might try to sabotage me.
